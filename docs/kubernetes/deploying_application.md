## Deploying Applications
- Deploying applications in Kubernetes involves creating and managing workload resources. This document will explain the different types of workload resources, provide a step-by-step guide for creating a basic deployment, and cover techniques for scaling applications horizontally and vertically.

### Workload Resources
- Pods: Pods are the basic building blocks in Kubernetes. They encapsulate one or more containers and share network and storage resources. Pods are generally not created directly; they are managed by higher-level resources like deployments or statefulsets.

- Deployments: Deployments provide declarative updates for pods and replica sets. They ensure that the desired number of pod replicas are running and handle scaling, rolling updates, and rollbacks.

- Replica Sets: Replica sets are responsible for maintaining a stable set of replica pods. They ensure the desired number of replicas are running at all times and can be used independently but are typically managed by deployments.

- StatefulSets: StatefulSets are used for managing stateful applications that require stable network identities and persistent storage. They provide unique hostnames, stable network identities, and ordered deployment and scaling.

### Creating a Basic Deployment
- To create a basic deployment, follow these steps:

- Write a YAML file describing the deployment. Include details such as the container image, port, and resource requirements.

- Use the kubectl apply command to create the deployment from the YAML file:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
- Verify that the deployment is running by checking the status:
```bash
kubectl get deployments
```

- View the created pods associated with the deployment:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

### Scaling Applications
- Scaling applications in Kubernetes can be done horizontally or vertically.

#### Horizontal Scaling:

- Use the kubectl scale command to scale the deployment to a desired number of replicas:
```bash
kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=<desired-replicas>
```
- Verify the scaling:
```bash
kubectl get deployments
```
#### Vertical Scaling:

- Edit the deployment YAML file to adjust the resource limits and requests for the containers.

- Apply the changes to the deployment:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

- Verify the changes:
```bash
kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>
```
